# Matlab-Kinematic_Analysis
Kinematic Analysis in MATLAB is commonly used in mechanical engineering, robotics, biomechanics, and other fields where motion analysis is required. It refers to the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. It typically involves analyzing the position, velocity, and acceleration of points or bodies in motion.
